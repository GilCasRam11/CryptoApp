# CryptoApp

üìå Project Description

Crypto App is an iOS application developed with SwiftUI, allowing users to view up-to-date cryptocurrency information using the CoinGecko API. It follows Clean Architecture and MVVM, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase.

# Architecture

The project follows the Clean Architecture pattern with MVVM, dividing the application into well-defined layers:

üü¢ Presentation Layer (UI)
* Contains SwiftUI Views (View) and ViewModels (ObservableObject).
* CryptoListView, CryptoDetailView, CryptoChartView manage the UI.
* ViewModels control the UI state and use Combine to update data.
  
üîµ Domain Layer (Business Logic)
* Contains the business logic of the application.
* CryptoModel and PricePoint define the data models.
* Defines the repository protocols (CryptoRepositoryProtocol).
* Uses UseCases for logic separation.

üü† Data Layer (Data Management)
* Implements data fetching from API and Core Data.
* APIClient manages HTTP requests.
* CryptoPersistence and CoreDataManager handle local data storage.
* CryptoRepository is the repository implementation that connects API and Core Data.

# Technologies Used

* SwiftUI - Declarative UI framework.
* Combine - Reactive programming for event handling.
* Core Data - Local data persistence.
* Clean Architecture - Modular architecture with responsibility separation.
* Swift Concurrency (async/await) - Modern asynchronous operations.
* XCTest - Unit testing with mocks.
*CoinGecko API (for cryptocurrency data)

# Installation and Execution

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git

cd CryptoApp

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the project in Xcode

Open CryptoApp.xcworkspace in Xcode.

Select a simulator or physical device.

Press CMD + R to run the application.

# Main Features

‚úÖ Cryptocurrency list with updated prices.

‚úÖ Detailed view of each cryptocurrency with price history.

‚úÖ Offline mode with Core Data (allows viewing data without an internet connection).

‚úÖ Search cryptocurrencies with SearchBar.

‚úÖ Currency switch (USD/EUR) with UI selection.

‚úÖ Charts to display price trends.

# Requirements 

* Requires Xcode 14+ and Swift 5.7+.
* Select a simulator with iOS 16+.

# Unit and UI Testing

üìç Unit Tests (XCTest)

Run unit tests with the following command:

CMD + U

Unit tests include:

Mock Repository: CryptoRepositoryMock.

API tests: Validation of API calls.

Data validation in Core Data.

üìç UI Tests (XCTest UI Tests)

UI Tests validate navigation and UI functionality.

Run UI Tests with:

CMD + U  # Runs all UI and unit tests

```
func testNavigateToCryptoDetailView() {
 
        let bitcoinCell = app.staticTexts["Bitcoin"
        
        XCTAssertTrue(bitcoinCell.waitForExistence(timeout: 10), "‚ùå The Bitcoin cell was not found in the list.")
        
        bitcoinCell.tap()
        let detailView = app.otherElements["CryptoDetailView"]
        
        XCTAssertTrue(detailView.waitForExistence(timeout: 10), "‚ùå The detail view did not appear after tapping.")
        
       print("‚úÖ Successfully navigated to the cryptocurrency detail view.")
       
    }
```
